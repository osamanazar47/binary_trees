0x1D. C - Binary trees

General:-
  . What is a binary tree

  . What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree

  . What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists

  . What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree

  . What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree

  . What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.

Tasks:-

 0. New node:
   a function that creates a binary tree node.
 
 1. Insert left:
   a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
  
 2. Insert right:
   a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

 3. Delete:
   a function that deletes an entire binary tree

 4. Is leaf:
   a function that checks if a node is a leaf

 5. Is root:
   a function that checks if a given node is a root

 6. Pre-order traversal:
   a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

 7. In-order traversal:
   a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

 8. Post-order traversal:
   a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

 9. Height:
   a function that measures the height of a binary tree

 10. Depth:
   a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree

 11. Size:
   a function that measures the size of a binary tree

 12. Leaves:
   a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree

 13. Nodes:
   a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

 14. Balance factor:
   a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
